# About the project

The project contains the prototype of a web application that provides to services:

* **Routing:** a service that finds a route with a minimal heat stress between two points at a given time.
* **Optimal time:** a service that finds an optimal point in time, i.e. a point in time with a minimal heat stress, for every place in a given radius that fulfill a criterion (e.g. is a supermarket). Additional for every place the optimal route between the start point and the place is computed.  

# Try it out
``` sh
$ git clone git://github.com/biggis-project/path-optimizer.git
$ cd path-optimizer
$ ./preprocess-data.sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

# TODO
- init script (runs after the user clones the repository)
  - download OSM / PBF dataset (parameter of the init script)
 Â - download thermal flight data from some URI for preprocessing purposes
  - we should create a tile pyramid for the frontend (currently a 1Mpx version is shown to the client)

- location api from graphhopper
